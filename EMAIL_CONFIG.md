# Email Configuration

## Resend Email Service Configuration

### Current "From" Email Address
The system currently uses the following "from" address for all outgoing emails:

**Email Address:** `support@ringing.org.uk`

This email address must be from a **verified domain** in your Resend account.

---

## How to Update the Email Address

When you need to change the "from" email address in the future:

### 1. Verify the New Domain in Resend
- Log into [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- Go to **Domains** â†’ **Add Domain**
- Add DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to verify ownership
- Wait for verification (can take up to 48 hours)

### 2. Update the Code
Update the `from` address in **`server.js`** in these 3 locations:

#### Location 1: Member Welcome Emails (line ~452)
```javascript
from: 'support@ringing.org.uk', // Verified Resend domain
```

#### Location 2: Campaign Emails (line ~610)
```javascript
from: 'support@ringing.org.uk', // Verified Resend domain
```

#### Location 3: Email Workflow Test Emails (line ~760)
```javascript
from: 'support@ringing.org.uk', // Verified Resend domain
```

### 3. Search and Replace
Use this command to find all occurrences:
```bash
grep -r "support@ringing.org.uk" server.js
```

Then replace with your new email address.

## Future Improvement: Environment Variable

For easier configuration management, consider using an environment variable:

1. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@ringing.org.uk
   ```

2. Update code to use:
   ```javascript
   from: process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL || 'support@ringing.org.uk',
   ```

This allows changing the email address without modifying code.
