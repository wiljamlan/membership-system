## Complexity Legend

- 🟢 **Easy** (1-3 hours): Minor additions, uses existing infrastructure
- 🟡 **Medium** (4-8 hours): New features, moderate complexity
- 🟠 **Medium-Hard** (8-15 hours): External integrations, complex UI
- 🔴 **Hard** (15-30 hours): Major features, architectural changes
- 🔴 **Very Hard** (40+ hours): Platform-level changes, new codebases

---

## Value Assessment Criteria

- **High Value**: Frequently requested, improves core functionality, competitive advantage
- **Medium Value**: Nice-to-have, improves specific workflows, niche use cases
- **Low Value**: Edge cases, rarely used, minimal impact (not included in this roadmap)

---

## Notes

- All time estimates assume a single developer working part-time
- Testing and bug fixes add ~20-30% to each estimate
- Some features depend on others (e.g., ticketing needs payment system)
- Features can be implemented in parallel if you have multiple developers
- User feedback should drive priority adjustments

---

## Maintenance & Technical Debt

**Ongoing Requirements** (not feature work, but necessary):
- Security updates for dependencies (monthly)
- Database backups and monitoring (automated)
- Performance optimization as user base grows
- Bug fixes and user support
- Documentation updates
- Infrastructure scaling

**Budget ~10-20% of development time for maintenance**
